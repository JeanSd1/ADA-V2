🏗️ Architecture Overview

⚡ TL;DR Quick Start (Experienced Developers)
Click to expand quick setup commands
🛠️ Installation Requirements
🆕 Absolute Beginner Setup (Start Here)
If you have never coded before, follow these steps first!

Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code (The Editor)

Download and install VS Code. This is where you will write code and run commands.
Step 2: Install Anaconda (The Manager)

Download Miniconda (a lightweight version of Anaconda).
This tool allows us to create isolated "playgrounds" (environments) for our code so different projects don't break each other.
Windows Users: During install, check "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" (even if it says not recommended, it makes things easier for beginners).
Step 3: Install Git (The Downloader)

Windows: Download Git for Windows.
Mac: Open the "Terminal" app (Cmd+Space, type Terminal) and type git. If not installed, it will ask to install developer tools—say yes.
Step 4: Get the Code

Open your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows).
Type this command and hit Enter:
git clone https://github.com/nazirlouis/ada_v2.git
This creates a folder named ada_v2.
Step 5: Open in VS Code

Open VS Code.
Go to File > Open Folder.
Select the ada_v2 folder you just downloaded.
Open the internal terminal: Press Ctrl + ~ (tilde) or go to Terminal > New Terminal.
⚠️ Technical Prerequisites
Once you have the basics above, continue here.

1. System Dependencies
MacOS:

# Audio Input/Output support (PyAudio)
brew install portaudio
Windows:

No additional system dependencies required!
2. Python Environment
Create a single Python 3.11 environment:

conda create -n ada_v2 python=3.11
conda activate ada_v2

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium
3. Frontend Setup
Requires Node.js 18+ and npm. Download from nodejs.org if not installed.

# Verify Node is installed
node --version  # Should show v18.x or higher

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
4. 🔐 Face Authentication Setup
To use the secure voice features, ADA needs to know what you look like.

Take a clear photo of your face (or use an existing one).
Rename the file to reference.jpg.
Drag and drop this file into the ada_v2/backend folder.
(Optional) You can toggle this feature on/off in settings.json by changing "face_auth_enabled": true/false.
⚙️ Configuration (settings.json)
The system creates a settings.json file on first run. You can modify this to change behavior:

Key	Type	Description
face_auth_enabled	bool	If true, blocks all AI interaction until your face is recognized via the camera.
tool_permissions	obj	Controls manual approval for specific tools.
tool_permissions.generate_cad	bool	If true, requires you to click "Confirm" on the UI before generating CAD.
tool_permissions.run_web_agent	bool	If true, requires confirmation before opening the browser agent.
tool_permissions.write_file	bool	Critical: Requires confirmation before the AI writes code/files to disk.
5. 🖨️ 3D Printer Setup
ADA V2 can slice STL files and send them directly to your 3D printer.

Supported Hardware:

Klipper/Moonraker (Creality K1, Voron, etc.)
OctoPrint instances
PrusaLink (Experimental)
Step 1: Install Slicer ADA uses OrcaSlicer (recommended) or PrusaSlicer to generate G-code.

Download and install OrcaSlicer.
Run it once to ensure profiles are created.
ADA automatically detects the installation path.
Step 2: Connect Printer

Ensure your printer and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.
Open the Printer Window in ADA (Cube icon).
ADA automatically scans for printers using mDNS.
Manual Connection: If your printer isn't found, use the "Add Printer" button and enter the IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.50).
6. 🔑 Gemini API Key Setup
ADA uses Google's Gemini API for voice and intelligence. You need a free API key.

Go to Google AI Studio.
Sign in with your Google account.
Click "Create API Key" and copy the generated key.
Create a file named .env in the ada_v2 folder (same level as README.md).
Add this line to the file:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Replace your_api_key_here with the key you copied.
Note: Keep this key private! Never commit your .env file to Git.

🚀 Running ADA V2
You have two options to run the app. Ensure your ada_v2 environment is active!

Option 1: The "Easy" Way (Single Terminal)
The app is smart enough to start the backend for you.

Open your terminal in the ada_v2 folder.
Activate your environment: conda activate ada_v2
Run:
npm run dev
The backend will start automatically in the background.
Option 2: The "Developer" Way (Two Terminals)
Use this if you want to see the Python logs (recommended for debugging).

Terminal 1 (Backend):

conda activate ada_v2
python backend/server.py
Terminal 2 (Frontend):

# Environment doesn't matter here, but keep it simple
npm run dev
✅ First Flight Checklist (Things to Test)
Voice Check: Say "Hello Ada". She should respond.
Vision Check: Look at the camera. If Face Auth is on, the lock screen should unlock.
CAD Check: Open the CAD window and say "Create a cube". Watch the logs.
Web Check: Open the Browser window and say "Go to Google".
Smart Home: If you have Kasa devices, say "Turn on the lights".
▶️ Commands & Tools Reference
🗣️ Voice Commands
"Switch project to [Name]"
"Create a new project called [Name]"
"Turn on the [Room] light"
"Make the light [Color]"
"Pause audio" / "Stop audio"
🧊 3D CAD
Prompt: "Create a 3D model of a hex bolt."
Iterate: "Make the head thinner." (Requires previous context)
Files: Saves to projects/[ProjectName]/output.stl.
🌐 Web Agent
Prompt: "Go to Amazon and find a USB-C cable under $10."
Note: The agent will auto-scroll, click, and type. Do not interfere with the browser window while it runs.
🖨️ Printing & Slicing
Auto-Discovery: ADA automatically finds printers on your network.
Slicing: Click "Slice & Print" on any generated 3D model.
Profiles: ADA intelligently selects the correct OrcaSlicer profile based on your printer's name (e.g., "Creality K1").
❓ Troubleshooting FAQ
Camera not working / Permission denied (Mac)
Symptoms: Error about camera access, or video feed shows black.

Solution:

Go to System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Camera.
Ensure your terminal app (e.g., Terminal, iTerm, VS Code) has camera access enabled.
Restart the app after granting permission.
GEMINI_API_KEY not found / Authentication Error
Symptoms: Backend crashes on startup with "API key not found".

Solution:

Make sure your .env file is in the root ada_v2 folder (not inside backend/).
Verify the format is exactly: GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key (no quotes, no spaces).
Restart the backend after editing the file.
WebSocket connection errors (1011)
Symptoms: websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError: 1011 (internal error).

Solution: This is a server-side issue from the Gemini API. Simply reconnect by clicking the connect button or saying "Hello Ada" again. If it persists, check your internet connection or try again later.

⚠️ Known Limitations
Limitation	Details
macOS & Windows	Tested on macOS 14+ and Windows 10/11. Linux is untested.
Camera Required	Face auth and gesture control need a working webcam.
Gemini API Quota	Free tier has rate limits; heavy CAD iteration may hit limits.
Network Dependency	Requires internet for Gemini API (no offline mode).
Single User	Face auth recognizes one person (the reference.jpg).
🤝 Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Here's how:

Fork the repository.
Create a branch: git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
Commit your changes: git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'
Push to the branch: git push origin feature/amazing-feature
Open a Pull Request with a clear description.
Development Tips
Run the backend separately (python backend/server.py) to see Python logs.
Use npm run dev without Electron during frontend development (faster reload).
The projects/ folder contains user data—don't commit it to Git.
🔒 Security Considerations
Aspect	Implementation
API Keys	Stored in .env, never committed to Git.
Face Data	Processed locally, never uploaded.
Tool Confirmations	Write/CAD/Web actions can require user approval.
No Cloud Storage	All project data stays on your machine.
Warning

Never share your .env file or reference.jpg. These contain sensitive credentials and biometric data.
